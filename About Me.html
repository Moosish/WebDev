        <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>&ensp;</p>
      <p>Located in Bristol, England.</p>

        <p>Currently studying Games Technology at the University of The West of England - Graduation in 2024.
        Modules currently being studied are Games in C++, Principles of 3D Environments, Games Tech 101 (Python) and Games Development Evolution.</p>
        
        <p>Interested in placement/internship opportunities for my placement year starting in the academic year of 2022. Additionally interested in part time opportunities in programming to further my skills.</p>
        
        <p>Work experience includes being a Team Member at Cineworld, wherein I worked together in a team within the fast-pace environment of a cinema. The role included many responsibilities such as ticket sales, food and drink preparation, cleaning, serving alcoholic beverages and providing support for both customers and supervisors to ensure smooth operation of the cinema. The experience of juggling multiple responsibilities in the fast environment that is cinema made me greatly more confident in my abilities in undergoing pressure along with teamwork and time management.</p>
        
        <p>Additionally, I have experience in being a Student Rep for Games Technology at UWE for two years.</p>
        
        <p>Hobbies of mine include 3D modelling, with my more confident choice of software being Blender (currently learning Maya in Principles of 3D Environments). Within Blender my current project is a 3D model of a Polaroid OneStep, with the majority of the modelling complete I am now learning texturing and UV unwrapping. I especially enjoy reading, with my favourite genres being non-fiction science books and fiction classic novels. I have recently finished reading 'Brief Answers To The Big Questions' by Stephen Hawking and am now reading 'Great Expectations' by Charles Dickens.</p>
        
        <p>Interest wise - I am inquisitive over new techniques within video games towards optimisation, such as when a new video game releases, how has it been optimised to run at the speed it does? I find great enjoyment in exploring digital art and 3D art, following a great number of artists on platforms such as Instagram for both expanding my own knowledge and techniques and showing appreciation of the medium. Science is another interest that I find fascinating, with my favourite topic being over Cosmology. I am always interested in how the universe works and it's an area I chose to surround myself in with frequent book readings and study.</p>
